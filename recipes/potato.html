    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This sweet potato pie recipe was shared with me by a special friend in Atlanta, GA. It has long been a favorite, and everyone who tastes it says it is the best they've ever had!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1 pound) sweet potato, with skin</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place whole sweet potato in pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Boil until tender when pierced with a fork, 40 to 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove sweet potato from the pot and run under cold water. Remove and discard skin. Break sweet potato flesh apart and place in a bowl. Add butter and mix with an electric mixer until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, milk, eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla; beat on medium speed until mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour filling into unbaked pie crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool before serving.</li>
    </ol>
